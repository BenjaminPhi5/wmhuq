methods to test:

SSN_proximity class

InteractiveLoss class


so I need to get the proximity maps for l1 for every item in the batch.

I could define the loss function on the entropy, not on the target, which would be kinda good I guess.
i could then give the model the mean and the distribution as input, yeah I kinda like that idea.
or I could compute the mean sample by picking the median class value that would be a good idea yes nice.

when doing QC i can do best dice, average dice, worst dice or median dice, I think it might be best as predicting median dice actually.
