I think for P-Unet just pick 50
I think for SSN just pick 20 we did it 'emperically'.

THAT IS IT! MODELS ARE TRAINED. DONE. NEED TO MAKE PLOTS TOMORROW!!!!

so: models that I have
mc dropout versions
back norm
deterministic
ensemble
evidential
ssn
ssn gaussian mixture
ssn anchor
epinet
ensemble ssn


picking 20 for ssn and 50 for p-unet, slightly higher was needed.
